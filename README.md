## Usage

By default, WIP is setting a pull request status to pending if it finds one of the following terms in the pull request titles

- `wip`
- `work in progress`
- `ðŸš§`

The pro plan allows for [configuration](#configuration) of both the terms and the locations that the app is looking for the terms. The pending status can be overwritten by adding `@wip ready for review` to the pull request body.

## Configuration

Repositories belonging to an account or organization with a Pro plan subscription can be configured by creating a `.github/wip.yml` file. Two options can be configured

1. **locations**: any of `title` (pull request title), `label_name` and `commit_subject` (1st line of the pull requestâ€™s commit messages). Default: `title`
2. **terms**: list of strings to look for in the defined locations. All terms are case-insensitive. Default: `wip`, `work in progress` and `ðŸš§`

Example:

```yaml
locations:
- title
- label_name
- commit_subject
terms:
- do not merge
- â›”
```

The above configuration makes WIP look for "do not merge" and "â›”" in the pull request title, all assigned label names and all commit subjects.

You can also configure different terms for different locations:

```yaml
- terms: ðŸš§
  locations:
  - title
  - label_name
- terms:
  - fixup!
  - squash!
  locations: commit_subject
```

The above configuration looks first for `ðŸš§` in the pull request title and assigned label names. After that it looks for `fixup!` and `squash!` in the commit subjects.

## About WIP

Besides being a hopefully useful GitHub application, the WIP app is also meant as a reference implementation. I try to keep the complexity low and the code easy to follow. If you are thinking of creating your own GitHub app, the WIP might be a good starting point for you.

Besides the code, I also made our [policies](https://github.com/wip/policies) good templates for your app.

All revenue from the "pro" plan will be donated to [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/). I only added the paid plan to make the WIP a real-life GitHub App example. If you cannot pay but depend on the pro features you can add your account with an explanation to the [`pro-plan-for-free.js` file]([`pro-plan-for-free.js).

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to create an issue.
